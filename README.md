# üáπüá∑ Turkey Electricity Consumption Prediction (Hourly-Based)

This project focuses on **forecasting hourly electricity consumption (T√úKETƒ∞M)** in Turkey using historical data, employing two different modeling approaches:

- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**
- **Attention-Based LSTM (AT-LSTM)**

## üìä Dataset Overview

- **Time Range**: January 2022 ‚Äì March 2025  
- **Frequency**: Hourly  
- **Target Feature**: `T√úKETƒ∞M` (Consumption in MW)  
- **Additional Features**: `√úRETƒ∞M`, `ƒ∞THALAT`, `ƒ∞HRACAT`

### üåÄ Detected Seasonality

- **Daily Seasonality**: 24 hours  
- **Weekly Seasonality**: 168 hours

## üß† Models Used

### 1. SARIMA
- Classical time series model  
- Incorporates seasonal patterns using `seasonal_order = 24`

### 2. AT-LSTM (Attention-Based LSTM)
- Neural network with **LSTM** and **attention mechanism**
- **Window Size**: 48 hours (past 48 hours used to predict the next hour)
- Attention helps identify which time steps are most important to the prediction

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

| **Model**  | **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** | **R¬≤ Score** |
|------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| AT-LSTM    | **325.10**                    | **0.99**     |
| SARIMA     | 3014.65                       | 0.56         |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **AT-LSTM significantly outperformed SARIMA** in both accuracy and explanatory power.

## üîç Attention Insights

The attention mechanism revealed that the **most recent time steps** (especially the last few hours in the 48-hour input window) contribute most to the forecast:

üìå This demonstrates the AT-LSTM model's ability to **capture short-term temporal dependencies**, improving the accuracy of electricity demand forecasting.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- **SARIMA** is simple but limited in capturing nonlinear temporal relationships.
- **AT-LSTM** excels in detecting short-term patterns and offers **higher accuracy**.
- The attention mechanism provides **interpretability**, showing which past values influence the forecast the most.

This project illustrates the strength of combining **deep learning and attention mechanisms** in time series forecasting tasks.
